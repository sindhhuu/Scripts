# Prior to working on the assignment, you'd better check out the corresponding course material:
#  - [Exploratory data analysis with Pandas](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_english/topic01_pandas_data_analysis/topic1_pandas_data_analysis.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as an interactive web-based [Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-1-exploratory-data-analysis-with-pandas)
#  - first lectures in mlcourse.ai [YouTube playlist ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKTuw4PNOsU&list=PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu-UcN9BbwiX) 
#  - you can also practice with demo assignments, which are simpler and already shared with solutions: [A1 demo](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a1-demo-pandas-and-uci-adult-dataset), [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a1-demo-pandas-and-uci-adult-dataset-solution)
# 
# ### Your task is to:
#  1. write code and perform computations in the cells below
#  2. choose answers in the [webform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxhQ9Bg4OpM3E5N47ZuRbILgDuMRbvEnUbDMZK8L-NU). Solutions will be shared only with those who've filled in this form 
#  3. submit answers with some email and **remember it**! This will be your ID during the course. Specify your real full name in the form as well (no nicks allowed in the final top-100 [rating](https://mlcourse.ai/rating)). If in doubt, you can re-submit the form till the deadline for A1, no problem, but stick to only one email.
#  
# ### <center> Deadline for A1: 2019 September 15, 20:59 GMT (London time)
#     
# You'll get up to 10 credits for this assignment.
# 
# ### How to get help
# In [ODS Slack](https://opendatascience.slack.com) (if you still don't have access, fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10HAN5huM996snUKjsNYyT_oOlm2uOsTKulKurb3oiNM/) mentioned on the mlcourse.ai main page), we have a channel **#mlcourse_ai_news** with announcements from the course team.
# You can discuss the course content freely in the **#mlcourse_ai** channel (we still have a huge Russian-speaking group, they have a separate channel **#mlcourse_ai_rus**).
# 
# Here's how you reply in a thread (press this dialog icon to drill down into a thread):
# 
# <img src="../../img/start_a_thread.png" />
# 
# Please stick to special threads *a1_q1-5_fall2019* and *a1_q6-10_fall2019* in **#mlcourse_ai_news** for your questions on A1. Help each other without sharing correct code and answers. Our TA **Vadim @vchulski** is there to help (only in the mentioned thread, do not write to him directly).
# 
# Lastly, you can save useful messages by pinning them, further you can find pinned items on the top, just below the channel name:
